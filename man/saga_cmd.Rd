\usage{
saga_cmd(
  saga_path = getOption("pemprepr.saga_path", default = ._pempreprenv_$saga_path)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{saga_path}{Path to \code{saga_cmd} executable file. By default consults
\code{getOption("pemprepr.saga_path")}.}
}
\value{
path to saga_cmd executable
}
\description{
Accepts a path to the \code{saga_cmd(.exe)} executable, or looks in
\code{getOption("pemprepr.saga_path")}. After being run once, sets an internal
variable so that the path is remembered in subsequent runs in the same R
session.
}
\details{
It is recommended to set the option in your \code{.Rprofile} file with:
\code{options("pemprepr.saga_path" = "path to your saga_cmd(.exe) file")}. This
will ensure SAGA is always found when it is needed.
